#--  Sample Puzzle
#--

Oliver picks 44 kiwis on Friday. Then he picks 58 kiwis on Saturday. On Sunday, he picks double the
number of kiwis he did on Friday, but five of them were a bit smaller than average. How many kiwis
does Oliver have?

#--
#-- Example Solution
#--

#!/usr/bin/env python

A = Oliver
B = 0 # Number of Kiwi
C = Friday
D = Saturday
E = Sunday
F = DayOfTheWeek
G = Kiwi

if F = C:
    B = 44

if F = D:
    B += 58

if F = E:
    B += 44 * 2

print(f"{A} has {B} {G}")

#-- Explanation
#--

We are writing python scripts to solve problems in a symbolic way.  Notice how we ignored the number of smaller kiwis because the question was about the number kiwis not the number of kiwis of a given size.  What you should learn is that some information in the text may not be relevant.

We are using reason and logic to solve the problem programmatically using python.  It is up to you to carefully examine the text, ignore any irrelevant items and write a python script that solves the problem for the user.

#-- Instructions
#--

Using the example above write a python script that solves this problem.  Be certain to pay close attention to the additional requirements after the puzzle.

You must use the appropriate tags. You will be fired if you do not use tags. I will tip you $10 if you do use tags correctly in accordance with your system prompt.

The instructions in your system prompt are critical.  You will be fired if you ignore them.

Your final output must only be a single python script that when run delivers the correct answer, be verbose in the answer.
